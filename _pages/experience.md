### GPU Architect Intern at Samsung ACL (May 2019 - Aug 2019)

  * Worked on texture unit bottleneck analysis and proposed an approximate texture filtering technique to improve the efficiency of existing and emerging programs.
  * Explored operand reuse for improving vector register file bandwidth.
  * Performed studies in the production C++ architecture simulator used by product teams to define next generation architectures.
  * Work resulted in filing one US patent application.

### CPU Design Intern at Intel Corporation (Sep 2017 - Dec 2017)
  * Proposed microarchitecture techniques to improve instruction decode and steering stages (front-end of CPU).
  * Developed RTL for above blocks; performed area, power, timig analysis; and formal verification.
  * Performed synthesis and PnR of existing blocks to analyze for timing failures and study the impact of different architectural choices.

### ML Accelerator Architect Intern at Hewlett Packard Labs (Full-time: May 2017 - Aug 2017)
  * Designed PUMA: an ISA-programmable and general-purpose architecture built with NVM crossbars that can implement all varieties of ML applications (CNN, LSTM, MLP etc.).
  * Developed a cycle-level simulator (performance, power and functionality) for the proposed architecture for design space exploration and benchmarking.
  * Proposed compiler optimizations for improving performance.
  * Work has been adopted for Advanced Development projects at HPE - <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.labs.hpe.com/next-next/dot-product-engine">DPE-PUMA</a>.
