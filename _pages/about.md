Hi! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University. 

My research interestes are in computer architecture (microarchitecture, architecture, compilers) using emerging processor and memory technologies, with particular interest in machine learning. 

My PhD thesis explores hardware-software codesign for machine learning using in-memory computing. My notable contributions are are PUMA and PANTHER accelerator architectures for inference and training respectively. My research has resulted in the first open-source architecture simulator for ReRam-based accelerators (<a href="https://github.com/Aayush-Ankit/puma-simulator">performance model</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Aayush-Ankit/puma-functional-model">functional model</a>).

Prior to joining Purdue, I received B.Tech. in Electronics Engineering in 2015 from IIT (BHU) Varanasi, India where I graduated with honors and received the MITACS Globalink Fellowship.
